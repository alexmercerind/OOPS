## Recommended IDE, Compilers, Runtimes, Toolchains & Tools

Click on the links to start the direct download (for Windows x64).

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): IDE / Code editor of choice. Allows to install "extensions" for various languages and tools, without needed separate IDE for every programming language. Performant & lightweight. Available for all desktop platforms. Syntax highlighting works even without these extensions. Visual Studio Code is from Microsoft & available under open-source license.
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe): Python interpreter/runtime for running Python scripts/programs & Python Package Manager (pip) for installing external libraries (`python`/`python3`/`pip`/`pip3`).
- [**TDM GCC**](https://github.com/jmeubank/tdm-gcc/releases/download/v10.3.0-tdm64-2/tdm64-gcc-10.3.0-2.exe): A minimal GNU C/C++ compiler toolchain for Windows (`gcc`/`g++`).
- [**Java Development Kit**](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.16.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.16.1_1.msi): Java runtime & compiler (`java`/`javac`).
- [**Git for Windows**](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.38.0.windows.1/Git-2.38.0-64-bit.exe) __(optional)__: Source-code management & version control (`git`).

## Assigments

- [Assignment 1: Write a program to take a list of 10 farmers, fruits they sell, their cities & the quantity of fruits they have as input. Save the data to notepad before & after sorting based on quantity in tabular manner. Also perform search operation based on farmers' name.](./assignments/1.md)
- [Assignment 2: Write a program to take quantity & quality of fruits Mango, Apple & Papaya as input. Quality may be good, bad or average. If entered quantity of fruit is greater than 1000, store it as half. Perform search for a given fruit with given quality.](./assignments/2.md)
- [Assignment 3: There are four orchards, namely A, B, C & D with fruits in them as Apple, Litchi, Mango, Apple respectively. The qualities of the fruits in the orchards are good, good, good & bad respectively. Based on that: 1. The available orchards in a tree-view. 2. Search for a given fruit in the available orchards after taking input from the user & print the tree.](./assignments/3.md)
- Assignment 4: Take or make a map of any building & generate a graph.
- [Assignment 5: Take a map provided as a graph & display all the subtrees of connected points.](./assignments/5.md)
- [Assignment 6: Enter entry point & goal point & produce the matching subtree of the graph.](./assignments/6.md)
- [Assignment 7: Give the weightage for each edge of nodes, and produce the shortest path from start to end node.](./assignments/7.md)
- [Assignment 8: Write a program to demonstrate the use of all keywords made for exception handling.](./assignments/8.md)
- [Assignment 9: Write a program to demonstrate the use of only `throw` keyword.](./assignments/9.md)
- [Assignment 10: Write a program to demonstrate the use of only `try` & `catch` keywords.](./assignments/10.md)
- [Assignment 11: Write a program to demonstrate the use of only `throws` keyword.](./assignments/11.md)
- [Assignment 12: Write a program to withraw money from a bank account, if the withdrawn money is greater than the balance, then it throws `NoMoneyException`.](./assignments/12.md)
