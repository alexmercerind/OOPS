# Assignment - 7

## Objective

Give the weightage for each edge of nodes, and produce the shortest path from start to end node.

## Programming Language & Compilation

- [Python 3.9.x +](https://python.org/)

```bash
# install networkx (https://github.com/networkx/networkx)
$ python3 -m pip install networkx
# install https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
$ python3 -m pip install matplotlib
# run the code below
$ python3 main.py
```

## Source Code

The implementation derives from the code written in the [Assignment - 6](./6.md).

Major improvements in this version include the introduction of new `Destination` class which is used to pass various reachable destinations from a `Location` along with their weight/path-length.

Thus, calculated sub-graph is more precise due to correctly assigned weights to various edges.

```py
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


class Destination:
    name: str
    edge_weightage: int

    def __init__(self, name: str, edge_weightage: int):
        self.name = name
        self.edge_weightage = edge_weightage


# A `Location` object describes a location on the map, which holds:
# 1. Name of that location.
# 2. Other `Destinations` that it is connected to.
#
# This data is then later used to create a graph.
#
class Location:
    name: str
    connections: list["Destination"]

    def __init__(self, name: str, connections: list["Destination"]):
        self.name = name
        self.connections = connections


# Primary class to visualize the given map.
# This class contains the main logic to create the graph and visualize it.
# Takes in a list of `Location` objects in its parameterized constructor.
class MapVisualizer:
    # Used for map visualization.
    visual: list[list] = []

    def __init__(self, locations: list[Location]):
        # Iterate over the nodes, provided as `Location` objects.
        for a in locations:
            for b in a.connections:
                self.add_edge(a.name, b.name, b.edge_weightage)

    # Gets the sub-graph providing the shortest path between two locations.
    # Uses dijkstra algorithm.

        # returns path as a `list`.
        path = nx.shortest_path(
            graph,
            start,
            end,
            method="dijkstra",

        edges = [(path[i], path[i + 1]) for i in range(len(path) - 1)]
