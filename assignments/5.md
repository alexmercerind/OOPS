# Assignment - 5

## Objective

Take a map provided as a graph & display all the subtrees of connected points.

## Programming Language & Compilation

- [Python 3.9.x +](https://python.org/)

```bash
# install networkx (https://github.com/networkx/networkx)
$ python3 -m pip install networkx
# install https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
$ python3 -m pip install matplotlib
# run the code below
$ python3 main.py
```

## Source Code

```py
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# A `Location` object describes a location on the map, which holds:
# 1. Name of that location.
# 2. Other locations that it is connected to.
#
# This data is then later used to create a graph.
#
class Location:
    name: str
    connections: list[str]

    def __init__(self, name: str, connections: list[str]):
        self.name = name
        self.connections = connections


# Primary class to visualize the given map.
# This class contains the main logic to create the graph and visualize it.
# Takes in a list of `Location` objects in its parameterized constructor.
class MapVisualizer:
    # Used for map visualization.
    visual: list[list[str]] = []

    def __init__(self, locations: list[Location]):
        # Iterate over the nodes, provided as `Location` objects.
        for a in locations:
            for b in a.connections:
                self.add_edge(a.name, b)

    # A helper method to connect to location nodes.
    def add_edge(self, a: str, b: str):
        self.visual.append([a, b])

    # Display the created map as graph.
    def visualize(self):
        graph = nx.Graph()
        graph.add_edges_from(self.visual)

        nx.draw(
            graph,
            with_labels=True,
            node_color="#81d4fa",

In this example, all the locations are connected, thus a single large subtree is generated.
