# Assignment - 6

## Objective

Enter entry point & goal point & produce the matching subtree of the graph.

## Programming Language & Compilation

- [Python 3.9.x +](https://python.org/)

```bash
# install networkx (https://github.com/networkx/networkx)
$ python3 -m pip install networkx
# install https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
$ python3 -m pip install matplotlib
# run the code below
$ python3 main.py
```

## Source Code

The implementation derives from the code written in the [Assignment - 5](./5.md).

Now `MapVisualizer` contains two new methods:

- `get_shortest_path_subgraph`: returns `nx.Graph` after finding shortest path between `start` and `end` using Dijkstra.
- `visualize_shortest_path`: shows the matching subtree in user-interface.

Thus, shortest path between the entry point & goal point is calculated and then the matching subtree of the graph is drawn.

More details are available as comments in the code snippet below.

Though, generated [outputs](#output) are good most of the times, there can be few issues because no weightage is assigned to the edges. This is addressed in the [Assignment - 7](./7.md), because we give account to weightage aswell there.

**CORRECT:** Shortest path sub-graph from `Library` to `Chhoti Market`.

**CORRECT:** Shortest path sub-graph from `Badi Market` to `TIC`.

**INCORRECT:** Shortest path sub-graph from `Visvesvaraya Bhawan` to `Tagore Bhawan`.

This is because `College of Technology` is acting as single node between the two & the two other nodes with the correct shortest path i.e. `Patel Bhawan` and `Silver Jubliee Bhawan` make the path longer without manually assigned weightage.
Even though, in real life, `College of Technology` is situated way far compared to these two nodes i.e. `Patel Bhawan` and `Silver Jubliee Bhawan`.

This is addressed in the [Assignment - 7](./7.md), because we give account to weightage aswell there.
