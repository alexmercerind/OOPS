# Assignment - 3

## Objective

There are four orchards, namely A, B, C & D with fruits in them as Apple, Litchi, Mango, Apple respectively. The qualities of the fruits in the orchards are good, good, good & bad respectively.

1. The available orchards in a tree-view.
2. Search for a given fruit in the available orchards after taking input from the user & print the tree.

## Programming Language & Compilation

- [Python 3.9.x +](https://python.org/)

```bash
# install rich (https://github.com/textualize/rich)
$ python3 -m pip install rich
# run the code
$ python3 main.py
```

## Source Code

```py
from enum import Enum
from rich.tree import Tree
from rich import print


# Available fruit qualities.
class Quality(Enum):
    GOOD: int = 0
    BAD: int = 1


# An orchard model to bind name of orchard, fruit in that orchard & its quality together.
class Orchard:
    name: str
    fruit: str
    quality: Quality

    # Initialize object attributes from constructor.
    def __init__(self, name, fruit, quality):
        self.name = name
        self.fruit = fruit
        self.quality = quality

# Actual logic implementation class
class OrchardProvider:
    # Available orchards to us.
    orchards: list[Orchard] = [
        Orchard("A", "Apple", Quality.GOOD),
        Orchard("B", "Litchi", Quality.GOOD),
        Orchard("C", "Mango", Quality.GOOD),
        Orchard("D", "Apple", Quality.BAD),
    ]

    # Constructor. Printing available orchards upon object creation.
    def __init__(self):
        print("[green]Available Orchards:")
        self.print_available()

    # Prints available orchards in a tree view.
    def print_available(self):
        tree = Tree("[yellow]Orchards")
        for orchard in self.orchards:
            node = tree.add("[yellow]" + orchard.name)
            node.add("[yellow]" + orchard.fruit)
            node.add("[yellow]" + orchard.quality.name)
        print(tree)

    # Searches for a given fruit name in available orchards & prints the tree view.
    def search(self, fruit_name: str):
        flag = False
        tree = Tree("[yellow]Results")
        # Search for fruit name in available orchards.
        for orchard in self.orchards:
            if fruit_name == orchard.fruit:
                flag = True
                node = tree.add("[yellow]" + orchard.name)
                node.add("[yellow]" + orchard.fruit)
                node.add("[yellow]" + orchard.quality.name)
        if flag:
            print(tree)
        else:
            print("[red]No results found.")


# Entry point of the application.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create new object instance.
    orchard_provider = OrchardProvider()
    while True:
        # Search with the help of object created above.
        fruit_name = input("Enter fruit to search:")
        orchard_provider.search(fruit_name)

```
