Handling object relationships within code:

| Relation       | Handling    |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Aggregation    | References  |
| Composition    | References  |
| Generalization | Abstraction |
| Realization    | Interface   |

Relations may also be:

- one-to-one uni-directional
- one-to-one bi-directional
- one-to-many uni-directional
- one-to-many bi-directional

> Bank and Customers are a good example of one-to-many relationship.

## S.O.L.I.D. Principles

- S - Single-responsiblity Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Example: School & Department

> Tightly-Coupled & One-To-One. Both objects have strong dependency on one another.

```java
class School {
  private Department d;

  School() {
    d = new Department(this);
  }

  // Public getter.
  public Department getDepartment() {
    return d;
  }
}

class Department {
  // Keeps reference to that particular School instance.
  private School s;

  // Take reference.
  Department(School school) {
    s = school;
  }

  // Public getter.
  public School getSchool() {
    return s;
  }
}
```
