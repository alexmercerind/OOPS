## Thread

A small path of execution of a program is called a thread.

Threads have two types primarily:

- Kernel thread.
- User thread.

> An operating system has various threads & subroutines for various things like I/O, networking & print spooler etc.


## Mutual Exclusion

The order of execution is not defined in two or more independently existing/running threads.

Mutual exclusion gives programmer ability to define/control this behavior (the order of execution & synchronization etc.).
