## Error

Examples:

- Memory failure (RAM).
- Accessing unavailble data.
- Power failure error.

## Exception Handling

Examples:

1. Something which is **checked** (or already known) to handle that situation.

> Can be handled by self & so is checked.

2. **Unchecked** + Errors

> Checked, but cannot be handled by self.

## Compile - Time Exception

#### a.k.a. _"Checked Exception"_

> Compiler / Interpreter knows. Also, the programmer knows how to handle it.

- Using variable without declaring it.
- Trying to change/re-assign `const` identifier.
- Syntax error.
- Treating local variable as a global variable.

## Runtime Exception

#### a.k.a. _"Unchecked Exception"_

- Index out of bound exeption.
- Condition not terminated.
- Arithmetic exception.
- Using freed memory.
- De-refrencing NULL or dangling pointer.
- Memory leak.
- Uncompatile exception.
- ENF / DNF.
- Class not found.

These are unchecked but still resolved only by the programmer's help. Only some exceptions can be handled with the help of compiler.

## 5 Keywords

There are 5 keywords for exception handling in most programming languages.

- `try`
- `catch`
- `throw`
- `throws`
- `finally`

> We cannot `try` without `catch`.
> We cannot `catch` without `try`.

## Exception Chaining

- Some exceptions are useful to us in a particular situation / time.
- So that paricular exception can be handled at a particular & desired situation & time.
- Thus, we chain exceptions up.
